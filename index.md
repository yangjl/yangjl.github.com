I am a little girl's father; got my PhD in plant genetics; an R user and a python coder. Highly support for open science and reproducible research. As the Big Data explosion, especially the next generation sequencing (NGS) data in genomic area, collaboration across multiple disciplines to solve a single problem become vital importance. If you are interested in genetics, statistics, machine learning (ML), parallel computing or data visualization, then I am your friend.
