I am a father, a plant geneticist, and a data hacker. I am highly supportive for open science and reproducible research. As the Big Data explosion, especially the next generation sequencing (NGS) data in genomics area, collaboration across multiple disciplines to solve a single problem become vital importance. If you are interested in genetics, statistics, machine learning (ML), parallel computing or data mining, then I am your friend.
