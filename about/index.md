## RESEARCH INTERESTS:

I am interested in using quantitative genetics tools including 1) Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) to identify yield-associated loci and 2) Genomic Selection (GS) to facilitate crop breeding by estimating individual plantâ€™s genetic merit. 

I am also interested in big genetic data interpretation by integrating and optimizing various Omics information, such as phenomics, genomics, transcriptomics and metabolics. I had collaborated with iPlant by using high performance computation (HPC) capability to work on two-dimensional eQTL detections. Recently, we collaborated with Spalding lab at the Univ. of Wisconsin-Madison to conduct dynamic GWAS using their real time image data.
